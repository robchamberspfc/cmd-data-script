# cmd-data-scripts

Two script to add the appropriate data into Neo4j and Mongo with either enough data to load the cpih01 dataset or with this complete and published.

May need to tweak location/hosts for it to work for you if setup different or databases installed differently...

load-ready.sh - Currently clears out Neo/Mongo data and adds enough to import a file

published.sh - Loads a published dataset
